# Context

Glossary for `hudline`. Terms only — no implementation detail, no spec.

## Status line

The single line of text this package writes to stdout. Claude Code renders it
verbatim beneath the prompt. It is the entire product surface.

## Host

An agent CLI that renders a Status line by **running a command and displaying
its stdout** — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI, Qwen Code,
Cursor CLI, Factory Droid. Every Host uses that same mechanism and a different
Payload shape. A Host is the thing a Status line is installed *into*.

Being an agent CLI is not enough to be a Host. Codex CLI and opencode render
their status lines from a fixed set of built-in items and run no command at
all, so nothing here can be installed into them — a limit of the CLI, not a gap
in this package.

## Payload

The JSON object a Host writes to this package's stdin on every refresh. The
sole source of live data while rendering. This package never reads a Host's
settings file in order to render.

## Adapter

The per-Host mapping from Payload shape to Fields. The Adapter is what makes
one Format portable: `{ctx}` names a *meaning*, and each Adapter knows where
that meaning lives in its own Host's Payload. An Adapter also declares which
Fields its Host cannot supply at all — those Fields are permanently Missing
there.

## Field

One addressable piece of data — `ctx`, `wk`, `sent`, `model`, `effort`. A Field
is a **value**, not a value plus a label: the label is authored by whoever
writes the Format (see below), never by the Field itself. A Field may know more
than one Representation of its value; which one is used is not its decision.

Most Fields are drawn from the Payload and some from a transcript. A
**derived** Field is drawn from other Fields instead — it is the one kind that
knows other Fields exist, and it still never learns which Host it is running
on.

## Quota window

A time-bounded allowance reported by a Host. The **5-hour quota window** and
the **weekly quota window** each report the percentage of allowance remaining
and, when available, their own reset time. They are separate allowances: one
does not reduce or reset the other.

## Conversation

The span every token total is counted over. Its boundary is one transcript:
`/clear` starts a new Conversation and the totals begin again at zero,
`--resume` continues an existing one, and a subagent's turns belong to the
Conversation that spawned it.

Compaction does **not** end a Conversation. This is the one consequence a
reader will guess wrong: after a compaction the context window empties while
the token totals keep climbing, and both numbers are right. They are answering
different questions.

## Token flow

What the token Fields measure — how much has moved over a Conversation. A flow
meter, not a bill. Cost and remaining allowance are already answered elsewhere
on the line, and a second, quieter answer to a question already answered is
worth less than a straight answer to one nothing else asks.

Flow is counted in two layers, never as one flat list:

- **Input** — everything sent to the model. Cache reads and cache writes are a
  **breakdown** of Input, not peers of it.
- **Output** — everything the model produced. Thinking is a breakdown of
  Output.
- **Total** — Input plus Output. Nothing else is added, because everything else
  is already inside one of those two.

A breakdown never joins the sum. That rule is why the layering exists at all: a
flat list of five numbers gives the reader no way to tell which of them already
contains which, and they will assume wrong in whichever direction makes the
line look sensible.

In steady state a Conversation is overwhelmingly cache reads — 98% is ordinary.
That is not a caveat about the number, it *is* the number: caching is what
makes a long Conversation affordable, and a flow meter that buried it would be
measuring the wrong thing.

## Available / Missing

A Field is **Missing** when the Payload does not carry it — `wk` under API-key
auth, `effort` on a model that has no effort setting, `cwd` when absent.
Missing is not the same as zero: a token count of 0 is Available.

A **ratio** is where that rule has to be read carefully. `0` is a legitimate
count — nothing moved, and nothing is the answer. A ratio with no denominator
has no answer: before the first response there is no Input for cache reads to
be a share *of*. Printing `0%` there would assert that the cache never hit,
when what is true is that nothing has been asked yet. Such a Field is Missing,
and reappears on its own once there is something to divide by.

**Policy: a Missing Field never renders a placeholder.** It causes the text
around it to disappear instead. `n/a` is not written, because status line width
is the scarcest resource in the product.

## Format

The user-authored description of what the Status line should look like. The
Format is the configuration surface of this package — designing a status line
*means* writing a Format.

## Default format

The Format used when the user supplies none. It is a product decision, not a
fallback: `npx -y hudline` with no arguments must produce a status
line worth using as-is. Configuration is an escape hatch, never a prerequisite.

## Segment

A top-level unit of the Format, delimited by `|`. A Segment is the **unit of
disappearance**: a Missing Field that no Group encloses takes its whole Segment
with it. Surviving Segments are joined by the Separator.

## Group

`[...]` inside a Segment. A Group is a narrower unit of disappearance than a
Segment, and may nest. A Missing Field removes only its innermost enclosing
Group.

## Placeholder

`{field}` inside a Format. Substituted with a Field's value.

## Separator

The string placed between surviving Segments. Not part of the Format — the `|`
in a Format marks a boundary, it is not itself the Separator.

## Theme

The **how** of a Status line, as against the Format's **what**. A Theme owns
the palette every colour is drawn from, which Representation of a Field is
drawn, the Separator, the phrasebook a Narration is said in, and the colour of
the literal text a Format carries.

Literal text is of two kinds and a Theme colours them apart. The words a
Format's author wrote are **content**. The punctuation around them — brackets,
parens, the Separator — is the **skeleton** holding the content up. Painting
the skeleton as loudly as the content is the difference between a line that is
coloured and a line that is designed.

The division is the one an Adapter already draws for Hosts, applied to
appearance: one Format survives a change of Theme, because a Format never names
a colour. Whoever writes a Format cannot choose colours, and does not have to.

## Chip

A Field drawn with a filled background rather than coloured text. A Chip is how
a Theme gives one Field visual weight without depending on terminal width: the
fill sits behind that Field's own characters, so nothing is padded out to the
edge of the screen and nothing breaks when the line wraps.

## Representation

One of the forms a Field's value can take — `61%` and `▰▰▰▱▱ 61%` are two
Representations of the same Field. The Field declares which Representations it
has; the **Theme** chooses among them.

That choice can change how wide the Status line is. This is the Theme's to
make, not a fault: it is the same trade the reader makes by picking a look.

## Meter

A Representation that draws a percentage as a bar. A Meter's footprint is fixed
— the spent part of the track is drawn, not left blank — so a Status line does
not jitter as the value it reports moves.

## Narration

A derived Field that says, in one sentence, the most alarming thing true right
now — and says nothing at all when nothing is. Saying nothing is the normal
case: a Narration that is Missing takes its Segment with it, so the line simply
does not carry one.

It decides *what* is worth saying by asking the Threshold colour rather than by
keeping cut-offs of its own. A number painted red and a sentence saying all is
well cannot end up side by side if there is only one place that answer comes
from. It says **one** thing, and picks the one that will stop the reader soonest
rather than the one with the worst number. A weekly quota at 12% is the worse
news, but nothing can be done about it this hour and a context window at 88%
is three messages away — the sentence goes to whichever the reader can act on
now. A Status line that says four things at once says none of them.

How the thing is said is not its decision either: a Narration yields a token,
and the Theme keeps the phrasebook.

A Narration reports **state**, never events. It cannot say what just happened,
because nothing here remembers a previous render.

## Threshold colour

Colour applied to a Field's value according to how alarming the value is
(context nearly full, weekly quota nearly spent). It belongs to the **Field**,
not to the Format: it answers "is this number dangerous right now", which is a
property of the data.

A Theme supplies the palette a Threshold colour is drawn from, never the
choice: on a Field's value the Threshold colour always wins. A Theme that could
paint a dangerous number in a calm colour would be a Theme that lies, which is
the one thing a Status line must not do.

Literal text is never coloured *by the author of a Format*. It is coloured by
the Theme.

## Wizard

The interactive, run-once mode (`init`) that builds a Format by menu and
installs it into a Host's settings file. The Wizard is a *writer*; the renderer
is a *reader*. They share the Format and nothing else — notably, the renderer
must never pay for the Wizard's existence at startup.

## Installing

Writing a Format into a Host's settings file. Constrained by one rule: a Host's
settings file belongs to the Host and to the user, never to this package. Only
the `statusLine` key may be touched, a backup is taken first, the change is
shown before it is made, and any file this package cannot round-trip losslessly
(comments, non-standard JSON) is never written — the Wizard prints the snippet
instead.
